      <h2>Why is Life on Land important?</h2>
      <p>Terrestrial and forest ecosystems provide essential services, including air and water purification, soil formation, and climate regulation. They are also home to a vast array of biodiversity, with many species found nowhere else on Earth.</p>

      <p>Terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and deserts, support a wide range of plant and animal life. They play a critical role in regulating the climate, producing oxygen, and providing habitat for countless species.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Wetland Ecosystems</h2>
      <p>Wetlands, including swamps, marshes, and bogs, are unique ecosystems that provide habitat for a diverse range of plants and animals. They help to filter water, prevent flooding, and support fisheries.</p>

      <p>Wetlands are crucial for maintaining water quality, preventing soil erosion, and supporting biodiversity. They also provide important ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration and climate regulation.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Forest Ecosystems</h2>
      <p>Forests are vital for life on Earth. They absorb carbon dioxide, regulate the climate, provide habitat for countless species, and supply timber, fuel, and other resources.</p>

      <p>Forests play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity, protecting watersheds, and mitigating climate change. They also provide numerous benefits to human societies, including food security, medicine, and recreation.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Threats to Life on Land</h2>
      <p>Deforestation, land degradation, and habitat destruction are major threats to terrestrial and forest ecosystems. Human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development have led to widespread habitat loss and fragmentation.</p>
